## 📝 Published Research

I am a co-author of the research paper:

**"AnalySta: AI-Powered Stock Analysis Predict and Investment System"**  
Published in *International Journal of All Research Education and Scientific Methods (IJARESM)*, Vol. 13, Issue 4, April 2025.

The paper proposes an AI-powered stock market prediction system using advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, sentiment analysis with BERT NLP models, and explainable AI (SHAP) to improve transparency and accuracy. The system integrates real-time data, technical indicators, and social sentiment to provide actionable investment recommendations with an interactive dashboard for visualization.
